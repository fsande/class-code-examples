      <h2>Attendance at practical sessions</h2>
      <p> 
        The exercises proposed as practices are evaluated on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 12:00-14:00h.
        In these sessions, students are proposed programming exercises and the exercise proposed the previous week is reviewed.
        If on any occasion it happens that they cannot attend the practice evaluation session, the following protocol will be followed:

        <ul>
          <li>Inform the teacher of the incident in question as soon as possible.</li>
          <li>Be aware that missing a practice does not have to be a problem, since that 
					    grade can be recovered with other grades in the remaining practices. 
							What would be a problem is repeated non-attendance. </li>
          <li>If it is a formally justified reason, you can change your correction session 
					    to the other weekly session: if it is a Wednesday group, you can change to 
							Tuesday and vice versa.</li>
          <li><strong>No changes will be made</strong> to correct practices outside the week 
					    for which they have been planned: each week's practices are evaluated exclusively 
							in the corresponding sessions listed in the course timetable. </li>
